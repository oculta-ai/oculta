# Oculta

**Turn any prompt into a keyboard shortcut. Run it invisibly, inside any app.**

Oculta is a desktop AI assistant that lives in the background. Create custom AI shortcuts, trigger them with a keystroke, and get instant results — all without switching apps or breaking your flow.

## Key Features

- **Custom AI Shortcuts** — Build prompts and bind them to keyboard shortcuts. Grammar correction, code review, translation, summarization — anything you repeat, automate it.
- **Works in Any App** — Gmail, Slack, Notion, VS Code, or anywhere else. Oculta captures your selected text or screen, processes it, and delivers the result.
- **Invisible Mode** — Oculta is completely hidden during screen shares and recordings. Your AI workflow stays private.
- **Screenshot Analysis** — Capture your screen and let AI analyze what's on it. Solve problems, extract text, or get explanations.
- **AI Chat** — A built-in undetectable chat for quick questions and conversations.
- **Invisible Notes** — A scratchpad that stays hidden alongside everything else.
